# Contribution #

Contribution means helping the project get bigger and better, by any manner.  
If this is what your'e truly looking for, than you've come to the right place!

## Short Brief ##

### What is this file? ###
It is a set of guidence rules for developers who'd like to contribute to this repo.  
API changes, versions go forward but sometimes documentation is not, unfortunately.  
To address those issues and allow developers to contribute good, quality code - This file must exist and always be up to date.

### Dear Contributors ###
First of all, thank you for taking your time even considering contributing to this repo.  
It is extremely improtant to us that you, simple users or continous collaborators, 
contribute to this project in a combined effort to make it greater, stable than ever before.  

## Subbmiting Issues ##
Requests for new features and bug reports keep the project moving forward.

### Before you submit an issue ###
* Please make sure your'e using the latest version of Arduino CMake. 
Currently it's the one in the [master](https://github.com/arduino-cmake/arduino-cmake) branch,
but this will be updated once a version-release standard will be applied.
* Search the [issue list](https://github.com/arduino-cmake/arduino-cmake/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue)
(including closed ones) to make sure it hasn't already been reported.

### Subbmiting a good issue ###
Issues can be subbmited with a very short description, but that would make the life of the developers addressing it
very hard, leading to unresolved issues due to lack of information.  
Here is a set of rules you should apply to **every** issue you submit:
* Give the issue a short, clear title that describes the bug or feature request
* Include your Arduino SDK version
* Include your Operating System (No need to specify exact Linux version (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.) - Linux is just enough)
* Include steps to reproduce the issue
* If the issue regards a special behavior, maybe related to a specific board - Please tell us all you know about it 
and put some links to external sources if those exist. Not all of the developers are Arduino experts, and in fact there 
are so many types of boards and platforms that there being an "Arduino Expert" isn't even real.
* Use markdown formatting as appropriate to make the issue and code more readable.

## Adding Features
If you'd like to contribute a new feature, please do so on a seprate branch named `feature/name_of_feature` where 
*name_of_feature* is the very short and descriptive name of the feature your'e adding.  
If you don't have rights to create a new branch on this repo, feel free to fork it.  
  
Every completed feature should be Pull-Requested into [master](https://github.com/arduino-cmake/arduino-cmake), 
awating the approval of the project's collaborators.  
**Please Note:** Currently this project is under a heavy refactoring process, aiming towards a version 2.0.0 release.  
Until this version is released, new features should be merged **only** to the 
[Refactoring branch](https://github.com/arduino-cmake/arduino-cmake/tree/feature/refactoring).
